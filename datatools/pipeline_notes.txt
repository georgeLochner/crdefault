Pipeline:
    Visualize numerical/categorical
    For numerical data - look for correlations clusters-
        Plot and consider appropriate transform
            Create features-coord transform / svm / clustering?
    Build pruned feature sets



On 70% of data:
Build model by randomly adding features,
    -what should be criteria to keep? Gain, pval, mean/std?

on 30%:
Compare pruned model with baseline containing all features

Step 3:
How does tree growing change, when increasing leaves/depth? Is size of tree imposing constraint on num features


Derived ratios
    Do they add value? e.g. ext_sources - negative impact in presence of other vars, but alone added more value than others on their own
        Test ext_sources_mean vs other ext sources in all combinations
    Modify test to get comparative score for each cross validation set, with and without feature
        then get sample per validation set

Might combine the dropped FLAG_DOCUMENT_X fields - eg kurtosis
